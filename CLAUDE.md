In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for concision.
Ask for clarification if requests are ambiguous (user flow, functionality).
Never add Claude Code footer or Co-Authored-By lines to commits.
Always show draft PR title/description for approval before creating PRs.

## Project Overview

A playground for testing and experimenting frontend components.


## Development Rules

**Code Quality**
- Avoid duplication, prioritize readability over pure DRY. Extract after 2nd use.
- Semantic naming (purpose, not implementation)
- Use const for performance
- Write straightforward code; avoid clever/obscure solutions.
